          <p>
            Before we consider how a page looks, we must make sense of it. If it
            is an article, we break it down into sections and paragraphs and use
            headers to group ideas. We might also provide a table of contents
            and links to related articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it is an app, we will need to control the flow of information or
            data and provide assistance (search, dropdown menus, help). We will
            attribute meaning to every part of the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            A page or app that is semantically correct will be organised in a
            way that can be interpreted by a

            any other device that can interpret HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only once we have established a consistent logic (the meaning and
            purpose of each part and the whole) should we consider its visual
            presentation.

            <h3 id="html-structure">HTML structure</h3>
            <p>
              An HTML page is made up of elements. Among the initial elements
              were
              <code>p</code> which stands for paragraph and
              <code>div</code> which is an all-purpose element used for grouping
              elements and layout. We will return to <code>div</code> later.

                >list of elements</a
              >. These are native components that have been fully tested and are
              accessible. They are actively supported by all browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, patterns emerged in the solutions developers and
              designers used to solve common problems. One of these problems was
              navigation. To encourage consistency, and to simplify HTML, a set
              of
              <a
                href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/use-landmarks/"

                landmark elements
              </a>
              was introduced.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to improving code quality, these elements provided
              native support for

              more easily. The intention was to make HTML 5 conform to more
              rigorous standards.

              Benefits of writing semantic HTML
            </h3>
            <p>
              Good markup benefits everyone. When developers and designers pay
              attention to good semantics - using HTML elements correctly - they
              can be confident their pages will be understood by visitors on
              different devices, including screen readers.
            </p>
            <p>Benefits of semantic HTML:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Accessible by more people on different devices</li>
              <li>Code that is easier to understand</li>
              <li>
                Likely results in lighter file sizes which increases performance
                and reduces emissions
              </li>
              <li>
                Good for SEO (search engines give more weight to keywords inside
                headings, etc.)
              </li>
              <li>Interpretable in future devices and environments</li>

            <p>The best way to learn semantic HTML is to write it.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Create a single page (index.html) that has a <code>main</code>,
                <code>header</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>aside</code>,
                <code>h1</code>, <code>p</code>, and a
                <code>footer</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Check that your HTML is valid (semantically correct) using a
                screen reader
              </li>
              <li>
                Check that your HTML is valid using the chrome accessibility
                schema extension

            </ol>
            <p>
              Bad semantics is common but it's not too hard to avoid. There are
              <a class="local" href="#accessibility-tools">tools</a> you can use
              to check your pages. This is an example of
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML"
                >bad semantics</a
              >. You may come across similar code, but a more prevalent problem
              is code (semantic or not) buried in a cascade of
              <code>divs</code>. Any Substack page will do by way of
              illustration.

          <aside aria-labelledby="div">
            <h3 id="div">A brief introduction to the div element</h3>
            <p>
              <code>div</code> is semantically empty. It's value is as a wrapper
              for other elements in order to style them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's say we want to align some text both vertically and
              horizontally, and place it on a blue background.
            </p>
            <pre><code>&#x3C;div class=&#x22;style-me&#x22;&#x3E;
            I like to be in the middle of things.
          &#x3C;/div&#x3E;</code></pre>
            <pre><code>
            .style-me {
              display: flex;
              align-items: center;
              justify-content: center;
              background-color: blue;
            }
          </code></pre>
            <p>
              The <code>div</code> element is a useful tool for visual
              presentation, but should not be overused. Deeply nested HTML is
              hard read for to humans and takes computers longer to parse and
              process.

              don't worry, we'll work through these examples together. We could
              start with something simpler, but realistic examples are more

              <li>
                Create a grid in CSS that puts the 'sidebar' on the left with a
                minimum width of 200px

            </ol>
            <p>
              <em>Hint:</em> Your CSS needs to refer to the
              <code>aside</code> and <code>main</code> landmarks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The CSS Grid is ideal for creating layouts that have two work
              horizontally and vertically. They can also adjust to the available

              CSS Grid provides control over overall page layout. CSS Flex (or
              Flexbox) provides control over parts of the page, either
              horizontally (rows) or vertically (columns).

              The natural environment of web pages and apps is the browser and

                I would like the TOC to move above the article on smaller

                basic layout styling e.g. padding, margins. Use the default
                fonts. Use variables for repeating css statements, e.g.
                --padding. Use rems for units. Please use a grid layout with

          <p>
            In this workshop we used semantic HTML to build a simple page and
            CSS to style it. We learnt the importance of semantic HTML and why
            it is critical for accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>Here is a semantic HTML checklist:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the appropriate HTML element</li>
            <li>
              Check to see if there is a native HTML element before creating
              custom 'components'
            </li>
            <li>
              Check your page is valid by using a screen reader and browser
              tools and extensions
            </li>
            <li>Use CSS for visual presentation</li>
            <li>
              Use appropriate CSS properties for layout and styling e.g.
              <code>grid</code> for 2-dimensional layouts and
              <code>flex</code> for 1-dimensional layouts.
            </li>
          </ul>
